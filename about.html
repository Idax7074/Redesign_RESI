            La Fresca means “The Fresh One” and our vision is to bring people together in an increasingly busy world, through great fresh pasta. We believe that good food is about a moment in time to share with loved ones and a way to connect with
            each other, without the hassles of everyday life.

          <h2>A simple story</h2>
          <p>La Fresca was founded by Francesca and Fannar, the idea came during a trip to Bologna, the Italian capital of pasta and the cradle of lasagne.</p>
          <p>While strolling the streets of Bologna, we noticed fresh pasta stores everywhere and after trying for ourselves, we thought, wouldn't it be great to have this in Copenhagen?</p>
          <p>We decided to bring the concept of the pasta shop (pastificio in Italian) to Copenhagen to show that a great pasta dish can be prepared quickly and perfectly in your home, not just at the restaurant.</p>
